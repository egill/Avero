## Codebase Patterns
- RS485 status byte is at position 4 (frame[4]), NOT position 10
- Door status 0x02 (DOOR_RIGHT_OPEN_PROPERLY) = resting position = CLOSED
- Gate controller closes idle TCP connections - must reconnect before each command
- RS485 checksum validation: sum all 18 bytes, add 1, should equal 0
- CloudPlus checksum: XOR all bytes before checksum byte
- CloudPlus open command uses address=0xFF (broadcast), door=0x01
- RS485 poll interval in production is 250ms
- Serial port timeout should be 100ms, read accumulation timeout 200ms

## 2026-01-07 - Initial Setup
- Created benchmark scaffold in bench/rust and bench/go
- Build script working for cross-compilation
- **Learnings:**
  - cargo zigbuild works for aarch64 cross-compile
  - tokio-serial avoids libudev dependency issues
  - Gate at Avero HQ: 192.168.0.245:8000
  - RS485 at Avero HQ: /dev/ttyAMA4
