## Deployment Log

### 2026-01-08 10:27:54 UTC - Gate Correlation Fix Deployed (netto-grandi)

**Issue**: Gate latency showing 2-3 seconds instead of expected ~250ms

**Root Cause**: Old binary (`gateway-poc-bin` from Jan 7 19:52) correlated on `Moving` state,
which happens TWICE per door cycle (opening AND closing). The 2-3s "latency" was actually
measuring from gate_cmd to door CLOSING, not opening.

**Fix**: Deployed newer binary (Jan 7 23:17) that correlates on `Open` state instead.

**Change**: `gate_moving_correlated` → `gate_open_correlated`

**Expected Result**: Gate latency should now show actual door open time (~250-600ms)

**Data Analysis**: Compare journeys before vs after 10:27:54 UTC to verify improvement.

### 2026-01-08 10:45:54 UTC - ACC Dwell Matching Fix Deployed (netto-grandi)

**Issue**: ACC events not matching customers who had sufficient session dwell but 0 accumulated dwell

**Root Cause**: Commit 59ad8ab introduced a bug - `members_with_sufficient_dwell()` used accumulated_dwell_ms
exclusively, but accumulated_dwell_ms only updates on POS zone EXIT. While IN a zone, it stays at 0 (or
previous value). So customers with 90s+ session dwell in a POS zone weren't matching because accumulated=0.

**Symptom**: Logs showed `acc_group_exists_but_no_qualified_members` with `dwells_ms=[(track, 90058, Some(0))]`
meaning 90s session dwell but 0 accumulated.

**Fix**: Use MAX(session_dwell, accumulated_dwell) instead of just accumulated_dwell.
- session_dwell handles "still in zone" case (accumulated hasn't updated yet)
- accumulated_dwell handles zone flicker (re-entry after brief exit)

**Change**: `members_with_sufficient_dwell()` now computes `effective_dwell = session_dwell.max(accumulated)`

**Expected Result**: ACC events should match customers who are currently in POS zone with sufficient time.

## Test Gap Analysis Summary

Analysis Date: 2026-01-08
Current Test Count: ~100 tests
Overall Coverage: ~35% (estimated by module analysis)

### Coverage by Layer

| Layer | Tests | Coverage | Risk Level |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| Domain | 12 | ~40% | Medium |
| Services | 55 | ~60% | High |
| IO | 22 | ~20% | CRITICAL |
| Infrastructure | 18 | ~10% | CRITICAL |

### Zero-Test Modules (CRITICAL)

1. `io/acc_listener.rs` - Accepts untrusted network input from payment terminals
2. `io/egress_channel.rs` - Data pipeline to cloud
3. `io/mqtt_egress.rs` - MQTT publishing with QoS levels
4. `infra/broker.rs` - Embedded MQTT broker startup

### Business Logic Boundaries Untested (CRITICAL)

These time-sensitive boundaries determine customer authorization:

| Boundary | Module | Value | Impact |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| ACC group window | acc_collector | 10s | Customers grouped for payment matching |
| ACC recent exit | acc_collector | 1.5s | Authorization after leaving POS |
| Stitch grace time | stitcher | 4.5s/8s | Track identity continuity |
| Stitch distance | stitcher | 180cm/300cm | Spatial matching threshold |
| Door correlation | door_correlator | 5s | Gate command matching |
| Re-entry window | reentry_detector | 30s | Repeat visit linking |
| Height tolerance | stitcher/reentry | 10cm | Person height matching |

### Key Untested Scenarios

1. **Gate Blocked**: Unauthorized customer enters gate zone - common in production
2. **Chain Stitching**: Track A→B→C through multiple sensor gaps
3. **GROUP Bit Filtering**: Xovis group tracks (0x80000000 bit) should be skipped
4. **Re-entry Flow**: Customer exits and re-enters - journey should have parent reference
5. **Config Silent Fallback**: Invalid config silently uses defaults - masks production issues

### User Stories (US-001 to US-012)

All priority 1 (testing category):

- US-001: ACC Collector time boundary tests
- US-002: Stitcher time and distance boundary tests
- US-003: Door Correlator boundary tests
- US-004: Re-entry Detection tests
- US-005: Tracker edge case tests
- US-006: ACC Listener unit tests
- US-007: Egress Channel and MQTT Egress tests
- US-008: Protocol error handling tests
- US-009: Config validation tests
- US-010: Broker startup tests
- US-011: Domain type parsing tests
- US-012: Journey Manager state tests
- US-013: Barcode Fallback TDD tests (NEW)
- US-014: Journey scenario pattern tests (NEW)

### Barcode Fallback Feature (TDD)

New feature to implement with tests first:
- Receipt ID from ACC becomes barcode
- 45-minute TTL, single use
- Invalidated on physical exit (EXIT line cross)
- If Xovis loses track, barcode scan still opens gate
- API endpoint: POST /api/v1/barcode/scan (spec in ~/Documents/GitHub/Avero/docs/openapi.yaml)
- Stats: generated, scanned, invalidated_by_exit (both totals + time-series)

### Journey Patterns from TimescaleDB

Production data analysis (1343 journeys):
- **paid_exit** (782): entry_cross → POS dwell → ACC → gate_cmd → exit_cross
- **unpaid_exit** (270): entry_cross → brief POS → backward entry_cross
- **lost_unauthorized** (291): entry_cross → POS → tracking_lost

Event counts: 4-138 events per journey, most have 10-20

Key patterns to test:
- Multiple entry crosses (forward/backward/forward)
- Stitched journeys (pending → stitch → continue)
- Re-entry journeys (reentry_from parent reference)
- Mid-store spawn (track_create without entry_cross)
- Multi-POS visits with accumulated dwell

### Test Philosophy

Focus on meaningful business logic tests, not coverage metrics:
- Time boundary tests at critical authorization thresholds
- State machine transitions for door/journey lifecycle
- Error handling for network/protocol failures
- Validation of config to prevent production misconfigurations

Avoid:
- Testing trivial getters/setters
- Duplicating existing integration coverage
- Tests that just exercise code without business value

## Architecture Reference

### Data Flow
```
Ingress → Processing → Egress

Ingress:
  - MQTT (Xovis sensor) → ParsedEvent
  - RS485 (door state) → DoorStateChange
  - ACC TCP (payment terminal) → AccEvent

Processing (Tracker):
  - Person state management
  - Stitcher: track identity across gaps
  - JourneyManager: journey lifecycle
  - DoorCorrelator: gate command ↔ door state
  - AccCollector: payment event correlation

Egress:
  - JSONL file (journeys)
  - MQTT (events, metrics)
  - Prometheus HTTP
```

### Key Modules

| Module | Purpose | Test Status |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| tracker/ | Central orchestrator | Good coverage, edge cases missing |
| acc_collector | Payment matching | Time boundaries untested |
| stitcher | Track identity | Distance/time boundaries untested |
| door_correlator | Gate state matching | Window boundary untested |
| journey_manager | Journey lifecycle | Chain stitching untested |
| config | TOML loading | Validation untested |
| acc_listener | TCP protocol | ZERO tests |
| egress_channel | Data pipeline | ZERO tests |
| broker | MQTT broker | ZERO tests |
