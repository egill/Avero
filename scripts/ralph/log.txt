I've completed **US-010 - Add #[cold] attribute to error handling paths**.

**Summary:**
- Created dedicated `#[cold]` helper functions for error logging in both `gate.rs` and `cloudplus.rs`
- In `gate.rs`: Added 4 cold functions for TCP/HTTP client errors
- In `cloudplus.rs`: Added 4 cold functions for connect, read, write errors and timeout
- Updated all call sites to use these new helper functions
- All tests pass (108 tests), build succeeds, clippy passes with no warnings

**Files changed:**
- `src/services/gate.rs` - Added cold helper functions and updated call sites
- `src/io/cloudplus.rs` - Added cold helper functions and updated call sites
